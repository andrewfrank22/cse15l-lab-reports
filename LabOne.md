## command *cd*
1. example of using the command with no arguments.
   *cd* without an argument leads me back to the Home directory (out of any files that I opened)
3. example of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.
   *cd* with a path to a directory allows me to enter a folder.
   Must enter the main folder to access sub-folders.
   Cannot access *messages* folder before *lecture1* folder as the *lecture1* folder contains *messages* folder.
   i.e. *lecture1/messages*
5. example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.
   *cd* cannot be used with files, only directorys.

   > Will receive "Hello.java; Not a directory" as an error message*
