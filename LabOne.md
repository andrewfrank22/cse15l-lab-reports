1. ## **Example using the command with no arguments.**
   *cd* without an argument leads me back to the Home directory (out of any files that I opened)
2. ## **Example using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.**
   *cd* with a path to a directory allows me to enter a folder.
   Must enter the main folder to access sub-folders.
   Cannot access *messages* folder before *lecture1* folder as the *lecture1* folder contains *messages* folder.
   i.e. *lecture1/messages*
3. ## **Example using the command with a path to a file as an argument.**
   *cd* cannot be used with files, only directorys, with error message:

   > Hello.java; Not a directory as an error message

   > lecture1
2. ## **Example of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.**
     The *ls* used with a path to a directory as an argument lists all thr contents of the directory.      It is notable that the name of files are in a blue bold.
3. ## **Example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.**
   The *ls* command with a path to a file as an argument shows its location, proving it is in that directory.
